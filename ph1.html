<h3 id="what-is-free-will-">What is free will?</h3>
<p>The term Free Will has emerged over the past two millennia as the canonical designator for a significant kind of control over one's actions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your mind might be made up before you know it. Researchers have found patterns of brain activity that predict people's decisions up to 10 seconds before they are aware they have made a choice. The result was hard for some to stomach because it suggested that the unconscious brain calls the shots, making a free will an illusory afterthought. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> April 2008, Science Now Daily News</p>
</blockquote>
<p> &quot;Free will is not the defining feature of humanness modern neuroscience implies but is rather an illusion that endures only because biochemical complexity conceals the mechanisms of decision making.&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Science News, December 2008. The article was called The Decider.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In easy language, You can only perceive an action once it has already occurred.</p>

<p>The first study that was done on this was done by Kathleen Vohs and Jonathan Schooler, a pair of social psychologists. What they did was to divide their subject pool into three groups, and one group was given a passage to read saying that there's no free will and another group was given pro-free will passages, passages saying that you do have free will. The third group was given neutral passages, passages having nothing to do with free will. Then the next task was to take a math quiz and the subjects were told that the program was glitchy so that if they didn't press the space bar right after the questions showed up, then the answer would pop up on the screen, in which case, of course, they could cheat because they could see the answer. What they discovered is that the group who read the no free will passages cheated way more often than the other two groups. The other two groups behaved about the same which is evidence that free will is a kind of default assumption. They did a version of this study in which for correct answers you got a dollar for each one and so by cheating you were stealing and the <strong>people who read the no free will passages then stole more often than the others.</strong></p>

<li><strong>Deciding</strong>: To form an intention.</li>
<li><strong>PROXIMAL Intention</strong>: to decide NOW to do something NOW.</li>

<p>&quot;Our overall findings do suggest some fundamental characteristics of the simpler acts, that may be applicable to all consciously intended acts, and even to responsibility and free will.&quot;</p>

<p>Libet, unlike almost all of his followers, though that once you become aware of your intention, or decision, or urge to flex now, you had time to veto it. So, you had a kind of veto power. The window of opportunity for an exercise of veto power is about a 10th of a second, he thought. After that time, we're going to hit the point of no return, so it's going to be too late to cancel the urge, and muscle movement will be generated.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>FMRI</strong> stands for functional magnetic resonance imaging and measures blood oxygen level in the brain.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>EEG</strong> stands for electroencephalography. It is a very common method in neuroscience studies as it is relatively cheap to use.</p>
